An automated personal library inventory system featuring **Cutter-Sanborn** classification

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This repository serves as a cataloging engine that:

1. **Extracts Metadata**: Fetches book details (Author, Title, Category, Thumbnail) via the Google Books API using ISBNs.
2. **Calculates Cutter Codes**: Automatically generates alphanumeric codes to organize physical books by author and title sequence.
3. **Static Web Interface**: Deploys a searchable, sortable dashboard via GitHub Pages for mobile and desktop access.
